                    I led product design at Copilot as we strove to find and
                    then leverage product/market fit. Our proprietary ability to
                    access, process, and distribute data from leading Point of
                    Sale systems gave Copilot a unique ability to provide
                    enterprise level business insight to independent
                    restaurants.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We dramatically simplified the delivery of actionable
                    insights, focusing on timely push content rather a power
                    dashboard.

                  Once launched, <strong>not a single user</strong> logged in.
                  We designed and built Copilot's web product hand-in-hand with a loyal,
                  enthusiastic base of beta customers.
                  And yet, none of them actually wanted to use
                  what their feedback had helped shape.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But the problem wasn't the feature set. <strong>It was the delivery mechanism. </strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Recall that our target users have neither the
                  time nor the impulse to log into a web app. They're not even
                  in front of a computer for much of the day. Copilot needed to fit
                  seemlessly into their existing workflow.

                <p>We wanted Copilot to be another of our user's essential haibts - akin to
                their morning cup of coffee or pre-shift staff meeting.</p>
                <p>To establish this habit, Copilot needed to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Remind our users to review Copilot's benchmarks and insights</li>
                  <li>Be accessible despite our users' chaotic environments</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So as is so often the case in product design, I needed to simplify further.</p>

                  In parallel, we continued to discover the power of
                  benchmarking. Comparing current performance to the past was
                  useful, but it was even <em>more</em> useful to compare the
                  daily performance of a single location to that of a{" "}
                  <em>group of its peers</em>.
