                  - akin to their morning cup of coffee or pre-shift staff
                  meeting.

                <p>To establish this habit, Copilot needed to:</p>
                <ul className="arrow-list" style={{marginBottom:'1.5em'}}>
                  <li className="multi-line">
                    Remind users that a fresh version of Copilot's Daily Report was ready
                  </li>
                  <li>Be easily accessible in our users' chaotic environments</li>
                </ul>
                <p> I needed to simplify further.</p>
              </GridItem>
            </Grid>

            <img src={mobileExplorations} alt="" style={{maxWidth: '1200px', margin:'auto', marginBottom:'3em'}}/>

            <Grid>
              <GridItem centerTwo>
                <p>
                  In parallel, I continued to discover the compelling power of
                  benchmarking. Comparing current performance to the past was
                  interesting, but it was even <em>more</em> interesting to compare the
                  daily performance of a single location to that of a{" "}
                  <em>group of its peers</em>.
                </p>
                <p>Another key change the focus on push notifications. At 10am sharp, Copilot would notify
                users that their daily report was ready to review.</p>

                <h3 style={{color:colors.copilotBlue}}>Key Results</h3>
                <p>This time, the form factor and focus on notifications worked. Within a month, 80% of users
                were engaging with the daily report <em>every day</em>.</p>

                <p>
                  Peer group benchmarks proved especially compelling. Customers now considered
                  Copilot an essential part of running their business.
