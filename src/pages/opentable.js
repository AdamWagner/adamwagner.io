                <p>As a product manager at OpenTable, I worked on the availability system that connects restaurants and diners. In OpenTable's supply-constrained marketplace, incremental availability has a direct, positive impact for the business, guests, and restaurants.</p>


                <p>User research validated that the primary path to increasing availability was to enable restaurants to merchandise previously unutilized seats. And to do <em>that</em>, the product needed to enable restaurants to set guest expectations about their non-traditional dining experiences.</p>

                <p>The results were fantastic. The initiative has added more incremental availability than existed in some smaller geographic markets and is still growing. Beyond bottom-line benefit, it layed the groundwork for OpenTable to power more memorable, unique dining experiences for guests.</p>

                <p>
                  In the fall of 2015, myself and several colleagues
                  met with six restaurateurs in Los Angeles in search of
                  ways to increase reservation availability on OpenTable's marketplace.
                </p>
                <p>Questions focused on the reasons restaurateurs held back
                   tables from OpenTable. If OpenTable could address those
                   use cases, we could ostensibly increase table availability significantly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We began the research open-minded. But after three interviews, all of us
                  began zeroing in on an emerging opportunity: <strong>a way to set guest expectations
                  around non-traditional seats such as the bar or counter</strong>.
                </p>
              </GridItem>
            </Grid>


            <div className={s.researchQuote} img={research}>
              <p>“We need to manage people’s expectations about inside / outside / counter seating.
              </p>
              <p>The counter seating MUST be booked on the phone.
                Unless OpenTable had a way to tell the guest …”</p>
            </div>


            <Grid style={{ marginBottom: "6em" }}>
              <GridItem centerTwo>
                <p>
                  As of yet, OpenTable hadn't differentiated seating types.
                  A guest simply makes a 'reservation'. And to most guests — especially
                  those that have been with OpenTable since its fine-dining roots —
                  a reservation meant table service in the main dining room.
                </p>

                <p>It's easy to understand how guests could be upset:</p>
                <ul style={{marginBottom:'1.5em'}} className="multi-line">
                  <li><strong>Bar seating: </strong>Backless stools can be uncomfortable, the bar surface can be sticky, and parties larger than 3 will find conversation difficult.</li>
                  <li><strong>Patio seating: </strong>Sun, wind and rain can cause discomfort. At some restaurants, the patio may be a less energetic experience than the main dining room.</li>
                  <li><strong>High-Top seating: </strong>A High-Top is a raised table with raised seats that are sometimes backless. For parties with elderly guests or guests that use a wheelchair, High-Tops can be inconvinient at best and a show-stopper at worst.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Bottom line — guests need to know what kind of experience they're booking.
                  For hot restaurants with limited availability, guests would be willing to compromise just to get in.
                  And some guests simply <em>prefer</em> the bustling experience of dining at the bar.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If OpenTable could give guests the choice, restaurateurs could
                  open up an additional 30 - 60 percent of their tables for reservations.

                  The debate over outdoor seating
                </h3>
                <p>
                  No issue was more hotly debated than whether patio seating should
                  be included in version 1 as a <em>table type.</em>
                </p>
                <img src={outdoorDebate} alt=""style={{marginBottom:'1.5em'}}/>

                <p>
                  The conceptual friction not only compromised
                  the data model — it made it impossible to model <strong>bar seats located on the patio</strong>.
                </p>


                <p style={{marginBottom:'1.5em'}}>
                  Technical constraints prohibited the obvious approach of modeling
                  availability area attributes (indoor / outdoor)
                  in addition to availability seating types (bar, high-top, counter, etc).

                  This approach would more than double implementation time
                  and require a significant redesign of search services powering OpenTable's diner apps.
                  It would also explode the complexity of how OpenTable buckets availability types.

                <h4 style={{color:colors.red}}>Deferring dedicated area modeling</h4>
                <p>The effort to clean up the data model in a future iteration
                  was not significantly more than implementing it upfront. So, I descoped it —
                  opting to halve implementation time and take on the very real risk that phase 2 would never happen.

                <p>
                  In a sales-driven two-sided marketplace such as OpenTable, a
                  solid launch strategy is key to scaling adoption and engagement of a new feature.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The supply side needed to come first. Restaurants needed to be on board with
                  accepting reservations on their bar, high-top, patio, and counter seats in order
                  for guests to have the opportunity to engage.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Approach to supply side launch</strong></p>
                <ul className="arrow-list" style={{ marginBottom: "1.5em" }}>
                  <li>
                    Engage the sales team in a test market <em>early</em> in the development
                    process to gather feedback and engender support.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ensure all supporting collateral is ready for launch in test market
                  </li>
                  <li>Work with sales leadership to determine sales strategy. In this case,
                    position the feature not as an optional enhancement, but a fundamental update
                    to how OpenTable functions. Include setup as part of regular meetings with
                    restaurants.
                  </li>

                  <li>Work with sales leadership to define incentive plan linked to adoption.</li>
                  <li>Be on-site for initial setup meetings with restaurants in test market.</li>
                </ul>

                    On nights and weekends, <strong>I designed & built a custom KPI tracking dashboard</strong> {" "}

              <p>Restaurants that accepted parties at their bar, counter, high-top and outdoor seats saw an <strong>increase in the average order amount</strong> — especially at seats that are traditionally glorified waiting areas. </p>

              <p style={{marginBottom:'3em'}}>This feature also made restaurants effectively bigger. Restaurants were able to better utilize their large tables by seating more two-tops at the bar. Eric Kirkenmeier of the James Beard Award-winning restaurant <em>Cherry Circle Room</em> said “…it’s allowed us to <strong>fit more people in the room, period.</strong>”</p>

              <blockquote style={{padding:0, margin:'1.5em 0'}}>“We noticed a change in our revenue immediately; we noticed a change also in the spirits of the bartenders. It’s nice that we know for sure certain seats will always be full every single night.”

              <p>Because of the increased availability, guests were now more likely to find a spot at hot restaurants. As a bonus, many guests were excited by the option to <em>choose the bar</em>, which often offers a higher-energy dining experience.</p>

              <p>The feature added more incremental availability than some of OpenTable's smaller geographic regions. As expected, incremental bookings quickly followed the increase in availability, adding directly to OpenTable's bottom line.</p>
