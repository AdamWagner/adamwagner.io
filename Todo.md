Detail Page
x Migrate "splash" to canvas
x add "back" transition. Could scroll back to top before putting it back.
- Use simpler layout for project detail pages - they don't need the nav to load. The "for each" seems to be taking a lot of time there. EDIT: hmm, actually this doesn't seem to be happening.
- add prev / next at bottom of page
