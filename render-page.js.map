If it is a string (such as \"\\t\" or \"&nbsp;\"),\n//                      it contains the characters used to indent at each level.\n//          This method produces a JSON text from a JavaScript value.\n//          When an object value is found, if the object contains a toJSON\n//          method, its toJSON method will be called and the result will be\n//          stringified. A toJSON method does not serialize: it returns the\n//          value represented by the name/value pair that should be serialized,\n//          or undefined if nothing should be serialized. The toJSON method\n//          will be passed the key associated with the value, and this will be\n//          bound to the value.\n\n//          For example, this would serialize Dates as ISO strings.\n\n//              Date.prototype.toJSON = function (key) {\n//                  function f(n) {\n//                      // Format integers to have at least two digits.\n//                      return (n < 10)\n//                          ? \"0\" + n\n//                          : n;\n//                  }\n//                  return this.getUTCFullYear()   + \"-\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCMonth() + 1) + \"-\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCDate())      + \"T\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCHours())     + \":\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCMinutes())   + \":\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCSeconds())   + \"Z\";\n//              };\n\n//          You can provide an optional replacer method. It will be passed the\n//          key and value of each member, with this bound to the containing\n//          object. The value that is returned from your method will be\n//          serialized. If your method returns undefined, then the member will\n//          be excluded from the serialization.\n\n//          If the replacer parameter is an array of strings, then it will be\n//          used to select the members to be serialized. It filters the results\n//          such that only members with keys listed in the replacer array are\n//          stringified.\n\n//          Values that do not have JSON representations, such as undefined or\n//          functions, will not be serialized. Such values in objects will be\n//          dropped; in arrays they will be replaced with null. You can use\n//          a replacer function to replace those with JSON values.\n\n//          JSON.stringify(undefined) returns undefined.\n\n//          The optional space parameter produces a stringification of the\n//          value that is filled with line breaks and indentation to make it\n//          easier to read.\n\n//          If the space parameter is a non-empty string, then that string will\n//          be used for indentation. If the space parameter is a number, then\n//          the indentation will be that many spaces.\n\n//          Example:\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([\"e\", {pluribus: \"unum\"}]);\n//          // text is '[\"e\",{\"pluribus\":\"unum\"}]'\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([\"e\", {pluribus: \"unum\"}], null, \"\\t\");\n//          // text is '[\\n\\t\"e\",\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\t\"pluribus\": \"unum\"\\n\\t}\\n]'\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([new Date()], function (key, value) {\n//              return this[key] instanceof Date\n//                  ? \"Date(\" + this[key] + \")\"\n//                  : value;\n//          });\n//          // text is '[\"Date(---current time---)\"]'\n\n//      JSON.parse(text, reviver)\n//          This method parses a JSON text to produce an object or array.\n//          It can throw a SyntaxError exception.\n\n//          The optional reviver parameter is a function that can filter and\n//          transform the results. It receives each of the keys and values,\n//          and its return value is used instead of the original value.\n//          If it returns what it received, then the structure is not modified.\n//          If it returns undefined then the member is deleted.\n\n//          Example:\n\n//          // Parse the text. Values that look like ISO date strings will\n//          // be converted to Date objects.\n\n//          myData = JSON.parse(text, function (key, value) {\n//              var a;\n//              if (typeof value === \"string\") {\n//                  a =\n//   /^(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})T(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}(?:\\.\\d*)?)Z$/.exec(value);\n//                  if (a) {\n//                      return new Date(Date.UTC(+a[1], +a[2] - 1, +a[3], +a[4],\n//                          +a[5], +a[6]));\n//                  }\n//              }\n//              return value;\n//          });\n\n//          myData = JSON.parse('[\"Date(09/09/2001)\"]', function (key, value) {\n//              var d;\n//              if (typeof value === \"string\" &&\n//                      value.slice(0, 5) === \"Date(\" &&\n//                      value.slice(-1) === \")\") {\n//                  d = new Date(value.slice(5, -1));\n//                  if (d) {\n//                      return d;\n//                  }\n//              }\n//              return value;\n//          });\n\n//  This is a reference implementation.

Imagine doing a timeline.seek(0) and there's a callback that sits at 0.

For example, boxShadow has values like \"10px 10px 20px 30px rgb(255,0,0)\" which would utterly confuse other plugins. This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like \"s\" or \"xn1\" or \"xn2\") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like \"boxShadow_xn1\" and \"boxShadow_xn2\") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.\n\t\t\t * This method returns an object that has the following properties:\n\t\t\t *  - proxy: a generic object containing the starting values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin.

These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of \"extra\" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where \"s\" indicates string and \"n\" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be \"5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)\". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.\n\t\t\t * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):\n\t\t\t *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.\n\t\t\t *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)\n\t\t\t *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.\n\t\t\t *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.\n\t\t\t *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.\n\t\t\t * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.\n\t\t\t * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be \"width\".\n\t\t\t * @param {number} s Starting numeric value\n\t\t\t * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.\n\t\t\t * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.\n\t\t\t * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:\"1px solid red\"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.\n\t\t\t * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a \"clip:rect(...)\" tween in which case \"p\" might be xs1 but \"n\" is still \"clip\"\n\t\t\t * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded\n\t\t\t * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order.

The 2nd parameter should be a function that accepts 3 parameters:\n\t\t *  1) Target object whose property should be tweened (typically a DOM element)\n\t\t *  2) The end/destination value (could be a string, number, object, or whatever you want)\n\t\t *  3) The tween instance (you probably don't need to worry about this, but it can be useful for looking up information like the duration)\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Then, your function should return a function which will be called each time the tween gets rendered, passing a numeric \"ratio\" parameter to your function that indicates the change factor (usually between 0 and 1). For example:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * CSSPlugin.registerSpecialProp(\"myCustomProp\", function(target, value, tween) {\n\t\t *      var start = target.style.width;\n\t\t *      return function(ratio) {\n\t\t *              target.style.width = (start + value * ratio) + \"px\";\n\t\t *              console.log(\"set width to \" + target.style.width);\n\t\t *          }\n\t\t * }, 0);\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Then, when I do this tween, it will trigger my special property:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}});\n\t\t *\n\t\t * In the example, of course, we're just changing the width, but you can do anything you want.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @param {!string} name Property name (or comma-delimited list of property names) that should be intercepted and handled by your function. For example, if I define \"myCustomProp\", then it would handle that portion of the following tween: TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}})\n\t\t * @param {!function(Object, Object, Object, string):function(number)} onInitTween The function that will be called when a tween of this special property is performed. The function will receive 4 parameters: 1) Target object that should be tweened, 2) Value that was passed to the tween, 3) The tween instance itself (rarely used), and 4) The property name that's being tweened. Your function should return a function that should be called on every update of the tween. That function will receive a single parameter that is a \"change factor\" value (typically between 0 and 1) indicating the amount of change as a ratio. You can use this to determine how to set the values appropriately in your function.\n\t\t * @param {number=} priority Priority that helps the engine determine the order in which to set the properties (default: 0).
